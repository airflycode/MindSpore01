# Beyond Transformer

## Method

algo  -> framework/compiler -> hw

## Pros - Transformer as the unified compute engine

* NLP - LLM
* CV - 2111.06091v2
* RL - [Language  as the substrate of generalization](https://evjang.com/2021/12/17/lang-generalization.html)

##  Cons - Mammalian Neural System Update

1. Layer 4 (cortex input layer) differs between regions: Layer 4 of mouse neocortex differs in cell types and circuit organization between sensory areas
2.Molecular atlas of neuron diversity in mouse brain, showing differences in spatial distribution of neuron types between cortical areas
3. Great review covering the issue of themes and variations in circuits
4. Layer 5 (~cortex output layer) differs, both between regions, within region, and between species

### New hardware  - [ECRAM, FeFET, OSFET](https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-devices-for-analog-ai)
